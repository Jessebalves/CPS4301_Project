# CPS4301_Project
Dedicated repository for Project for Software Engineering class.

## Setting up development environment
Software that will be needed for development is Visual Studio Code(and the extension Live Server in VSCode), MySQL, and MySQLWorkbench. 
* Downloading and Installing Visual Studio Code:
  * Go the website https://code.visualstudio.com
  * Click the download button, note your operating system and install the corresponding stable installer (There are installers for Windows, Mac, and Linux)
  * After the download is complete, open the installer. You can click next through the rest of the installation set up as checking the boxes is not important. There is one box you can check to make a desktop icon for Visual Studio Code if needed.
  * If you can run linux commands, run the command git clone https://github.com/Jessebalves/CPS4301_Project.git and all the folders and files should be on your local machine. If you cannot run git, set up a KeanRoutes folder, and this is where all the program files will be.
  * After directory set up is complete, you can now open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
  * Navigate to the lefthand side of Visual Studio Code to an icon named Extensions, click on this. You will need to download an extension known as live server. This allows you to run a web server on your local machine so you can see the changes to your files in real time.
  * Right click on index.html and run with live server.
